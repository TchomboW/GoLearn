# raidCreateFIOtesting 


1. The `package main` statement indicates that this file is the main package for the Go program.

2. The `import` block lists all the necessary packages that are imported into the program. These packages contain functions and types needed by the program to function correctly.

3. The constant `iota + 1` initializes the `raid0`, `raid1`, etc., constants with integer values starting from 1.

4. In the `main()` function, it starts by calling the `listDrives()` function to get a list of available drives and assigning it to the `drives` variable.

5. It then checks if there are any drives available for benchmarking after excluding the OS drive.

6. If drives are available, the program presents the user with RAID configuration options: RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, JBOD, and destroying existing RAID arrays.

7. The program prompts the user to choose a configuration (option selected using `fmt.Scanln(&config)`), and based on the chosen option performs various actions:

   - If the user chooses option 5 to destroy existing RAID arrays, the program calls the `destroyRAID()` function and prints a message confirming that all RAID arrays have been 

destroyed.

   - For other options (RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5), it validates the RAID configuration with the `validateRAIDConfig()` function and then sets up the selected RAID configuration using the

`setupRAID()` function.

8. After setting up the RAID configuration, the program gets the appropriate RAID device for the chosen configuration (using the `getRaidDevice()` function).

9. The program then searches for the FIO executable file on the system with the help of the `findFioExecutable()` function.

10. It then creates a separate Goroutine for each drive and runs the FIO benchmark using the `runFIOWithProgress()` function, passing the appropriate parameters obtained from the 

`getFIOParams()` function.

11. Finally, once all the benchmarks are completed, it prints a message to indicate that all FIO tests have been successfully executed.
 
This program demonstrates an example of how one might interact with various packages and functions in Go to create a RAID configuration tool for benchmarking storage devices using the 

FIO test suite.
